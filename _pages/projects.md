### Research
---

<font size="3">My research focuses on the management of water supply systems to improve consumer welfare in water-scarce environments. The scale of these systems range from local distribution networks to large-scale regional water supply, where differences in scale require different modeling approaches. Overall, I seek to build optimization models that serve as design tools to aid in the decision-making process for water managers facing complex choices. The primary themes of work include:<</font>

<font size="3">1</font>. **<font size="3">Optimization under uncertainty:</font>** <font size="3">How can we create models that account for uncertainties, elucide tradeoffs between potential management strategies, distill complex results into accessible and actionable decisions.</font>


2. **<font size="3">Non-traditional water systems:</font>** <font size="3">From systems that heavily rely on desalination to combat water scarcity to intermittent systems in which consumers use local storage tanks to manage periods of non-supply, how do we account for the complexities introduced by unique systems to accurately capture system behvaior?</font>


3. **<font size="3">Resilience and equity: </font>** <font size="3">How do we implement control strategies that ensure the systems are resilient to climate shocks and how do we ensure that these strategies maintain equitable access to water for consumers?</font>
