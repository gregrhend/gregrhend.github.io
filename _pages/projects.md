*<font size="3"> My research utilizes optimization methods to maximize equity and resilience in non-traditional water supply systems </font>*

<font size="3">
My research focuses on the management of water supply systems to improve consumer welfare in water-scarce environments. The scale of these systems range from local distribution networks to large-scale regional water supply, where differences in scale require different modeling approaches. Overall, I seek to build optimization models that serve as design tools to aid in the decision-making process for water managers facing complex choices. The primary themes of work include:
</font>


1. <font size="3"> Optimization under uncertainty: How can we create models that account for uncertainties, elucide tradeoffs between potential management strategies, distill complex results into accessible and actionable decisions.</font>

<font size="3">
2. Non-traditional water systems: From systems that heavily rely on desalination to combat water scarcity to intermittent systems in which consumers use local storage tanks to manage periods of non-supply, how do we account for the complexities introduced by unique systems to accurately capture system behvaior?</font>

<font size="3">
3. Resilience and equity: How do we implement control strategies that ensure the systems are resilient to climate shocks and how do we ensure that these strategies maintain equitable access to water for consumers?</font>
