### Project Overview
<font size="3">
This research applied a new approach modeling consumer demands in intermittent water supply (IWS) systems that more accurately reflect consumer behavior in these systems. A Bayesian optimization approach is coupled with the IWS hydraulic model to strategically limit flow to some consumers in order to increase access to water for many more, thereby maximizing the supply equity in the system. In addition, the mechanisms through inequity emerges in IWS systems are analyzed under different scenarios of intermittent source supply.
