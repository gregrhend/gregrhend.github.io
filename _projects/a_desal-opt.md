### Project Overview:
This research introduces a two-stage optimization model coupled with multicriteria decision analysis, aiming to assess the impacts and trade-offs of investing in desalination processes for regional water systems in the face of uncertainty. The study specifically zooms in on the Israeli National Water Supply System (INWSS), showcasing the ways desalination investments enhance system robustness and reduce operational costs.

### Introduction:
Water scarcity is an escalating global issue, further intensified by unpredictable extreme climate events. The imbalances between water demand and available resources necessitate innovative solutions. Israel's INWSS serves as a case study here due to its strategic investment in the desalination sector, having successfully achieved water security against these adversities. Using this system as a basis, the research underscores the value of taking calculated risks, such as in upfront investments, even when faced with uncertainty, especially as historical data becomes less indicative of future conditions.

### Methods:
The primary framework is a two-stage optimization model supported by multicriteria decision analysis, as outlined in Figure 1. In the first stage, investment decisions for desalination are made without prior knowledge of future scenarios, while the second stage focuses on operational decisions after unveiling these scenarios. Multicriteria analysis aids in evaluating the results across different decision objectives, like system robustness and cost-effectiveness. This approach is particularly advantageous for systems that can't rely solely on historical data to predict future conditions, thereby sidestepping issues related to parameterizing uncertainty.

| Summary of plot. |

1. **Trade-offs & Robustness**: The research found that any increase in the desalination investment typically led to greater system robustness. The most robust solution entailed a 16% hike from the baseline cost. On the contrary, the least cost-focused solution recommended a slight decrease in the desalination investment.

2. **Stakeholder Preferences**: The multicriteria analysis framework is a valuable tool for incorporating stakeholder preferences directly into the decision-making process. By offering a comprehensive view of future scenarios and their outcomes, stakeholders can determine the best decision aligned with their preferences. This also simplifies the identification of compromises in case of conflicting stakeholder interests.

3. **Participatory Modeling & Collaboration**: Emphasizing a collaborative approach, the research advocates for the active involvement of stakeholders during all stages of model development, application, and validation. This not only helps in building trust but also encourages future partnerships and co-learning.

4. **Israel's Success Story**: Israel's emphasis on multi-decadal water system planning, its robust R&D investments, and public-private collaborations in the desalination sector stand out as the key drivers behind its water security achievements. This success story offers a practical roadmap for other regions looking to bolster their water management strategies through technologies like desalination.

5. **The Global Context:** With the rising global trend of desalination and increasing climatic extremities that challenge historical patterns, the methodology presented in this research can be adapted worldwide to address water insecurity challenges.

In conclusion, this work accentuates the promise desalination holds for regional water supplies, especially in extreme conditions. By following a structured approach, as showcased by Israel, regions worldwide can leverage cleaner production technologies to offer cost-effective solutions to the mounting water scarcity challenge.
