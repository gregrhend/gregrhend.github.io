### Project Overview:
<font size="3">
This research introduces a two-stage optimization model coupled with multicriteria decision analysis, aiming to assess the impacts and trade-offs of investing in desalination processes for regional water systems in the face of uncertainty. The study specifically zooms in on the Israeli National Water Supply System (INWSS), showcasing the ways desalination investments enhance system robustness and introduce tradeoffs between up-front capital costs and expected recourse costs.

### Introduction:
<font size="3">
Water scarcity is an escalating global issue, and to achieve a secure supply, regional water supply system managers must make decisions in the face of a plethora of uncertainties including consumer demands (municipal, agricultural, industrial), population growth, and climate conditions. Water supply systems in arid regions often rely on desalination to augment the traditional sources of water supply, thereby providing drought-resistent supply for the consuemrs but complicating the management decisions for water managers. With the inclusion of desalination, water managers need to consider the variance in salinity between the different supply sources and find the optimal mixing strategy to meet the necessary water quality goals in the system, all while contractual constraints enforced from the public-private partnerships that desalination plants are often funded through. Here we use the Israeli National Water Supply System (INWSS) as a case study to develop an optimization modeling framework that incorporates uncertainty, multi-quality-sources and desalination constraints in order to anlyze tradeoffs in up-front costs, expected recourse costs, and system robustness.

### Methods:
<font size="3">
The primary framework is a two-stage optimization model supported by multicriteria decision analysis, as outlined in Figure 1.

<font size="3">
In the first stage, investment decisions for desalination are made without prior knowledge of future scenarios, while the second stage focuses on operational decisions after unveiling these scenarios. The multicriteria analysis method PROMETHEE aids in evaluating the results across different cost and robustness objectives, with the aim of distilling the results into tradeoffs that are accessible and meaningful to project stakeholders. Given many different scenarios that represent the range of uncertainties faced by water managers, the PROMETHEE method finds that management decisions that most closely align with stated stakeholder preferences and a sensitivity analysis is performed on the preferences themselves to unveil tradeoffs between costs and system robustness.

### Insights:
1. **<font size="3">Trade-offs & Robustness:</font>** <font size="3">The research found that any increase in the desalination investment typically led to greater system robustness. The most robust solution entailed a 16% hike from the baseline cost. On the contrary, the least cost-focused solution recommended a slight decrease in the desalination investment.

2. **<font size="3">Stakeholder Preferences:</font>** <font size="3">The multicriteria analysis framework is a valuable tool for incorporating stakeholder preferences directly into the decision-making process. By offering a comprehensive view of future scenarios and their outcomes, stakeholders can determine the best decision aligned with their preferences. This also simplifies the identification of compromises in case of conflicting stakeholder interests.</font>

3. **<font size="3">Participatory Modeling & Collaboration:</font>** <font size="3">Emphasizing a collaborative approach, the research advocates for the active involvement of stakeholders during all stages of model development, application, and validation. This not only helps in building trust but also encourages future partnerships and co-learning.</font>

4. **<font size="3">Israel's Success Story:</font>** <font size="3">Israel's emphasis on multi-decadal water system planning, its robust R&D investments, and public-private collaborations in the desalination sector stand out as the key drivers behind its water security achievements. This success story offers a practical roadmap for other regions looking to bolster their water management strategies through technologies like desalination.</font>

5. **<font size="3">The Global Context:</font>** <font size="3">With the rising global trend of desalination and increasing climatic extremities that challenge historical patterns, the methodology presented in this research can be adapted worldwide to address water insecurity challenges.</font>

<font size="3">In conclusion, this work accentuates the promise desalination holds for regional water supplies, especially in extreme conditions. By following a structured approach, as showcased by Israel, regions worldwide can leverage cleaner production technologies to offer cost-effective solutions to the mounting water scarcity challenge.
